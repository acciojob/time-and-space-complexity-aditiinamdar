	  <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is, typically expressed using Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) scales linearly with the input size, meaning it remains efficient for small to moderately sized inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It includes both the fixed memory required by the algorithm and the temporary space it needs during execution. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size, which can impact performance on large datasets.</p>
